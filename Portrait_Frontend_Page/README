Portrait is a mobile app project that was created using React Native and Javascript. The app is made to be a social media style app that centers around
users being able to post photos, videos, and text. Currently, most of the code is focused on the frontend. Both the frontend and the backend are still a
work in progress. Creating this app has been extremly educational for me, on both the frontend and backend side of things.
