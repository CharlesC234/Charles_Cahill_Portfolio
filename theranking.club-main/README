TheRanking.club was a website created by  my friend, Rylan Richardson, and I. The site was written in HTML and EJS, CSS, and Javascript. The point of the website was
to allow people to make profiles or pages for themselves, then allow other users to vote on varius subjects and polls the users posted. The website was fully completed
and we launched here on campus at Florida Poly last fall amongst our friends. The website was more of a joke project that we completed in a few weekends, never meant to 
be sustainable or serve any real purpose outside of usage amongst us and our friends. We took the website down last spring, just because of server costs. Overall,
it was a great learning experience for me, and it is why I continued to learn Javascript and frontend design.
